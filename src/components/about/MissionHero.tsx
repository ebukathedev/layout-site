                    In Africa, getting digital skills can be tough. Many
                    people face barriers like limited access to resources,
                    outdated teaching methods, and overwhelming technical
                    jargon. Plus, staying motivated to finish a course can
                    be a real challenge. But at Layout, we&apos;re changing
                    that.
                </p>
                <p>Hence, Layout = digital skills + Fun!</p>
